## About

This is the official LaSalle Terrible ID Creation Tool. Currently the project is in it's earliest stages and there has yet to be a release. 

## Tooling
The goal of this application is to systematize the currently existing tooling utilized to create ID's. 
This application is created using Go alongside the Wails library for a GUI framework. Functionality is quite simple, as it is merely replacing a Powershell script, but allowing for far greater customization and previewing of the created identification files.

## Dependencies
In order to properly run this application, it is required to have access to all internal files, including but not limited to the student data. This is NOT included in the application or any existing repositories.
Additionally it is required to have the Zint application installed for printing.

## Installation
Currently, there are no releases, thus no installation options. However, if this application does gain interest, you can simply create a fork of the repository and build with Wails independently.
